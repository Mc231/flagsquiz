/// A business logic component (BLoC) that manages the state of a flag quiz game.
///
/// The `GameBloc` class extends `SingleSubscriptionBloc` to handle the
/// different game states, including loading and question answering phases.
/// It coordinates data retrieval, question generation, answer processing,
/// and the end-of-game evaluation.
///
/// The game logic is structured around a set of countries from a specific
/// continent, randomly picked questions, and user-provided answers. The
/// BLoC pattern ensures that the UI reacts to state changes emitted by the BLoC.
///
/// Constructor:
/// - `GameBloc`: Initializes with a specific continent, countries provider,
///   and random item picker.
/// - `GameBloc.standard`: Provides a default setup with a standard countries
///   provider and random item picker.
///
/// Usage involves initializing the BLoC, performing initial data load,
/// processing user answers, and handling game completion.
