/// A base class for providing resources asynchronously.
///
/// The `ResourceProvider` class serves as an abstract base class for creating
/// providers that load resources of type [T] asynchronously. It defines a
/// standard interface with a `provide` method that subclasses must implement
/// to supply the specific resource. This design allows for flexibility and
/// extensibility in managing various types of resources within an application.
///
/// Subclasses of `ResourceProvider` can be used to load data from different
/// sources, such as asset files, network requests, or databases, providing
/// a consistent interface for resource loading.
///
/// Example subclass implementation:
/// ```dart
/// class StringProvider extends ResourceProvider<String> {
///   final String source;
///
///   StringProvider(this.source);
///
///   @override
///   Future<String> provide() async {
///     // Logic to load the string resource
///     return 'Loaded resource from $source';
///   }
/// }
/// ```
abstract class ResourceProvider<T> {
  /// Creates a `ResourceProvider`.
  ///
  /// This constructor is marked as `const`, allowing subclasses to be
  /// instantiated as compile-time constants when no instance-specific data
  /// is involved.
  const ResourceProvider();

  /// Provides the resource of type [T].
  ///
  /// This method must be overridden by subclasses to implement the logic
  /// for asynchronously loading and returning the resource. It returns a
  /// `Future<T>` that completes with the loaded resource.
  ///
  /// Implementers should handle any errors that may occur during resource
  /// loading to ensure robust and resilient applications.
  Future<T> provide();
